## Using Collection Views , Create a photo gallery of your choosing . Maybe a gallery of Art, a gallery of nature photos, or a gallery of top players in the world . 

### Make sure to use the following :
- UICollectionView
- UICollectionViewCell
- To use & arrange your view collection , conform to UICollectionViewDataSource, UICollectionViewDelegate, UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout

## Bonus
- When clicking on an image , disply the image in full screen on another View Controller.  


### Your photo gallery should look similar to this (Note: You can design your own gallery as you wish) :

<div style="text-align:center; width: 100%; display: flext; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap;">
 <img src = "" style="width:50%; height: auto"/>
</div>
